# Wrangling_WeRateDogs

Real-world data is rarely tidy. Using Python and its tools, you will collect data from various sources and formats, analyse its quality and tidiness, and finally clean it. This is known as data wrangling. Your wrangling efforts will be documented in a Jupyter Notebook, and they will be shown through analyses and visualisations using Python (and its tools) and/or SQL.

The dataset you'll be manipulating (as well as analysing and visualising) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog rates, commonly known as WeRateDogs. It's a Twitter account that gives individuals ratings for their pets, along with a hilarious comment about the dog. WeRateDogs grabbed their Twitter archive and emailed it to Udacity specifically for your use in this project. This collection includes basic twitter data (tweet ID, date, content, and so on) for all 5000+ of their tweets as of August 1, 2017. More on this later.

## Project Specifics
Data wrangling consists of the following steps:
<ul><li>Data collection
 <li>Data evaluation
  <li>Data cleansing</li></ul>

### Data Analysis for this Project
After collecting all of the following data, visually and programmatically review it for quality and tidiness concerns. Detect and describe at least eight (8) quality flaws and two (2) tidiness concerns in your Jupyter Notebook wrangle act.ipynb. The concerns that fulfil the Project Motivation (see the Key Points header on the preceding page) must be examined in order to meet requirements.

### Data storage, analysis, and visualisation for this project
Keep the clean DataFrame(s) in a CSV file, the primary one being entitled twitter archive master.csv. If extra files are necessary for tidiness because several tables are required, name these files properly. You may also save the cleaned data in a SQLite database (which is to be submitted as well if you do).

In your wrangle act.ipynb Jupyter Notebook, analyse and visualise your wrangled data. A minimum of three (3) insights and one (1) visualisation must be created.
    
### Project Reporting
Make a 300-600 word written report named wrangle report.pdf or wrangle report.html that outlines your wrangling efforts concisely.
