Below are quality and tidiness issues identified.\n",

    "1. Removing all rows that have values in retweeted_status_id, retweeted_status_user_id, and retweeted_status_timestamp\n",

    "1. Some columns are not relevant, especially columns with higher null values\n",

    "2. Eliminating values without images from data to analyze \n",

    "3. The name column has 'None' has a name\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The name has a, an, the, etc. (Observed names that start with the lower case are not the real name)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Missing values in expanded_urls\n",
    "\n",
    "6. p1_dog', 'p2_dog', 'p3_dog' having some value set at false. It indicate the false values are not dog \n",
    "\n",
    "7. HTML syntax among the  content of sources rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. tweet_id is having an object data type insteadof int\n",

    "#### Tidiness issues\n",
    "1. Extract values and combined  doggo, flooder, pepper, and puppy to a single column form their various columns\n",
    "\n",
    "2. concate the three dataset and drop duplicate column if any."
